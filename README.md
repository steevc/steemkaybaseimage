Scratching an itch to save time shifting images to Kaybase storage to use on Steemit

To get an image into a Steemit post I needed to download it from Google Photos, possibly resize, rename,
copy to my Keybase public folder and then get a link that I can paste into the post. This script is to
automate that as much as possible.
